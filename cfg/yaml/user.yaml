# This yaml file was automatically generated by the application.
# The first time the app is executed, it will be copied to ~/.config/<appname>.yaml
# You can modify the values as needed, but unproper changes may lead to issues.
# If that is the case, just delete this file and rerun the application and all
# the values will revert to the default ones.
